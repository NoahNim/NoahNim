# Noah Medoff, Software Developer
### I'm a self taught and bootcamp disciplined computer programmer
I'm a nerd for coding. I'm always looking to learn more, experience self-growth, and collaborate with others. My love of problem solving helps me build and debug applications from an idea into a reality. I enjoy sharing my talents with a team of other inquisitve people. I'm looking to use my skills at a company that makes fun products that help society. I'm always thinking outside the box to overcome challenges, and I appreciate an environment that fosters such.
#### In Dune, Frank Herbert wrote <i>“Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just a little bit to test that it's a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain.”</i> To me this quote represents life both professionally and personally.
<b>Currently</b>, I'm working on a Discord chat bot that uses ChatGPT. I'm also practicing data structures and algorithims to keep my problem solving skills sharp.
<b>Most recently</b> I worked with my friend [Irene](https://github.com/imartinez921) to build an AI powered data analytics app for a Google and Square hackathon called [SALE-E](https://sale-e-w-supabase-mz2q4lmt7-imartinez921.vercel.app/).
<b>Next</b> I plan on contributing to open source projects.
